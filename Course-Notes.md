# Notes from Textbook
## Chapter 1
Python 
- run slower, programmer time is as valuable as CPU
- challenging language - concurrent multithreaded applications 

Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) - prevents the interpreter from executing more than one python instructions at a time.

Essentials:
- Numpy : numerical python
- Pandas : high level data structure and functions designed to make working with structures or tabular data fast, easy, and expressive.
  - panel data : mutli-dimensional structural datasets
- Matplotlib : producting plots and 2 dimensional data visualization
- IPython : interactive Python execute, explorer workflow
- Jupyter : design language - agnostic interactive computing tools; exploratory computing; markdown & html
  - kernel : a programming language mode
- SciPy : scientific computing
- Scikit-learn : general purpose machine learning toolkit
- Statsmodel : statistical analysis package
  - Regression, Anova, AR
