# **Can Money Buy Happiness?**
"Can money buy happiness?" is a popular quote often heard when a rich person isn't able to attain what will make him or her happy. However, does that same quote resonate with countries as a whole? Will a richer country have happier citizens? After all, many people want to immigrate to rich nations to enjoy an improved standard of living.<br><br>
In this study, the data collected centers on GDP (Gross Domestic Product) per capita, total population, and suicide mortality rate.   GDPs are normally calculated by using the country’s domestic currency, but when it comes to comparisons, the standard currency is the US$. For short, GDP measures everything produced within a country’s borders. A high GDP meant high standard of living.  GDP per capita is a country’s economic output per person. The suicide mortality rate is measured by the number of suicide deaths in a year per 100,000 population. This study is in comparison with the total population.<br><br>
Suicide stems from suicidal thoughts due to pain mixed with anger, regrets and guilt which could take many months or years to be resolved.  Besides, undue stress and hardship to the depressed person, the people surrounding the depressed person also get affected which deteriorates everybody’s work productivity and living conditions. As of the present, our medical community believes depression, suicidal thought, and negative emotions could be mitigated with pharmacological means. Turning on the TV, marketing for bi-polar, schizophrenia, and depression flood the network during advertisements.<br><br> 
As the standard of living rises and conveniences and health care becomes more accessible, does its citizen become more fragile? Does hardship teaches strength during adversity? Can pharma fix our anguish? Should our education teaches more on character building and values? Which is the highest age group who commits suicide? What should we be educating our citizens? These questions influences many sectors of life which is why the importance of this study affects fields such as mental health, education, employment, and population to mention a few. A continuous rise in suicide will make suicide one of leading causes of death in a country. Currently, the top 10 causes of death in United States and Canada is suicide while other countries might have other top 10 causes of death to worry about. There is a concern of a rise in suicide mortality rates that needs to be address before it gets out of proportion.  This study will compare data from North America countries, US and Canada with East Asian and Pacific countries, Philippines, China, Indonesia, Singapore, and Japan. <br><br>
As shown in the indicators, the United States and Canada belong to the high income brackets in North America and its counterpart on the high income bracket in East Asia and Pacific are Singapore and Japan. While the Indonesia and China are part of East Asia and Pacific but belong to upper middle income bracket. On the other hand, Philippines, a part of East Asia and Pacific, is on lower middle income bracket. The comparison of many East Asia and Pacific countries with North America countries is because the income brackets are more stable while in the East Asia and Pacific countries, some are established while others are emerging in their income brackets.<br><br>
## **Bubbly Plots for 2000 and 2016**
Below are bubble plots, there are 2 different plots and are differentiated by the years which are 2000 and 2016. The size of the bubble is dictated by the size of the population. The biggest to the smallest bubble based from population are as following: China, U.S., Indonesia, Japan, Philippines, Canada and Singapore.<br><br>
In the year 2000, the lowest GDP per capita was China but has a suicide mortality rate of 13.2. Its mortality rate is almost the same as high GDP per capita countries such as Singapore, United States and Canada. On the other hand, Indonesia and Philippines who have a low GDP but have lowest suicide mortality which is below 4. Japan has the highest suicide mortality was 24.7 with a high GDP per capita.

In the year 2016, China's GDP per capita leaped from slightly below $3,000 to slightly above $13,000, yet it was able to reduce it suicide mortality rate to 9.7. Japan whose GDP per capita started with a high $39.96 in 2000 has declined to $26.83 has also seen a reduction of suicide mortality rate to 18.5. However, the United States has an increase in their GDP per capita by almost 50% has seen the suicide mortality rate increase from 11.3 as of 2000 to 15.3 in 2016. The other North American country, Canada has an increase of their GDP per capita by almost 50% but has seen a reduction of a meager .5 from 13 to 12.5. Singapore doubled its GDP from 2000 to 2016 has seen a reduction of suicide mortality rate from 12.4 to 9.9

A look at a 3D plot puts into perspective the shallowness and depthness of the 3D scatterplot. Philippines is the closes to the inner corner and has the lowest GDP per capital (x-axis) and suicide mortality rate (y-axis). On the population presentation (z-axis), China has the biggest population, while Singapore has the smallest population. On the suicide mortality rate, Japan is at the outmost of the y axis.

## **Bar None** 
“Bar None” meant no exceptions. There is no exceptions in this bar chart presentation. All countries are experiencing growth in GDP per capita, growth in population (except Japan), and suicide mortality rate continues to plague the countries. 
While we look at the bar chart in comparison from 2000 to 2016, the population in East Asia and Pacific countries continues to grow as well as those in North America.

![2016 Bar Chart for Population](https://github.com/tmarissa/DATA-690-WANG/blob/main/world_development_explorer/Charts/2016%20Bar%20Pop.png)
The East Asian and Pacific countries' GDP per capita also increases with those of North American countries.

![2016 Bar Chart for GDP per capital](https://github.com/tmarissa/DATA-690-WANG/blob/main/world_development_explorer/Charts/2016%20Bar%20GDP.png)
However, the suicide mortality rate in East Asia and Pacific countries saw some reduction. Compared to those of North American countries, United States steadily increased and Canada saw its suicide mortality rate maintained.

## **Draw the Line**
There exist a line between North American and East Asia and Pacific countries. The United States’ and Canada’s suicide mortality hovers higher than 10 and can’t seem drop lower. Unlike Japan, whose suicide mortality rate started off at the high point of 24.7 in 2000 yet experiences continuous big drops which is down to 18.5 in 2016. <br>
The line chart showed that the United States' suicide mortality rate is high and persistently increases while other countries has experience dips or still hovering at below 4 in the 16 years span.

While United States and Canada are countries we can learn many things from, we might like to pick up some points which we should not to follow.
