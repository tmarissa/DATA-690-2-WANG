# **Assignment 9**  Point Estimate and Interval Estimate (Confidence Interval)

A random survey of enrollment at 35 community colleges across the United States yielded the following figures:<br>

- 6,414; 1,550; 2,109; 9,350; 21,828; 4,300; 5,944; 5,722; 2,825; 2,044; <br>

- 5,481; 5,200; 5,853; 2,750; 10,012; 6,357; 27,000; 9,414; 7,681; 3,200;<br>

- 17,500; 9,200; 7,380; 18,314; 6,557; 13,713; 17,768; 7,493; 2,771; 2,861; <br>

- 1,263; 7,285; 28,165; 5,080; 11,622<br>

Perform point estimate and interval estimate with 95% confidence level using t-distribution. Since we don't know the population variance, we use t-distribution instead of normal distribution.
